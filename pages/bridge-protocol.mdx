# Values Bridge Protocol

**Values Bridge Protocol** - a cross-blockchain bridge protocol that allows for the transfer of assets or data between two or more separate blockchain networks.
This is achieved by creating a bridge between the networks that can translate and map the information from one blockchain to another.
The bridge is composed of a set of smart contracts and cross chain messaging protocols that facilitate the communication and transfer of information between the different blockchains.
General idea is to allow for seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets and information across them.
