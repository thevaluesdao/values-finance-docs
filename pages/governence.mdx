# Values Governance

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are a unique form of digital organization that are built on blockchain technology and operate through the use of tokens.

In this docs, we will explore how **Values DAO** governance works and how it leverages the power of blockchain and tokens to achieve its objectives.

## How does Values DAO governance work?

DAO governance is achieved through the use of **sVALUES tokens**.
Individuals who hold these sVALUES tokens have a say in the decision-making process of the organization.
The number of tokens an individual holds determines their voting power, and this voting power can be used to make decisions about the direction and operation of the organization.

For example, if a DAO wants to make a change to its smart contract, a proposal is made and the token holders are able to vote on it.
If the proposal receives a certain number of votes, it is executed automatically by the smart contract.
This allows for a democratic and transparent decision-making process, as all token holders have an equal say in the outcome.

Another important aspect of Values DAO governance is the transparency it provides.
All transactions and decisions made by the DAO are recorded on a public blockchain, and can be audited by anyone.
This ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and that all stakeholders have access to the same information.

## Why is DAO governance beneficial?

DAO governance on a blockchain with sVALUES tokens provides a number of benefits over traditional forms of organization and governance.
These benefits include:

- **Decentralized decision-making:** Values DAO allow for decentralized decision-making, which can lead to a more equitable and democratic system.
  With traditional organizations, power is often concentrated in the hands of a small group of individuals or a single person.
  In contrast, a DAO operates through smart contracts on a blockchain network, which means that anyone with a certain amount of sVALUES tokens has a say in the decision-making process.

- **Efficient and transparent:** DAO can operate independently, without the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.
  This can lead to a more efficient and transparent system, as all transactions and decisions are recorded on a public blockchain and can be audited by anyone.

- **Independence:** DAO can be useful in situations where traditional organizations are not able to operate, such as in countries with corrupt governments or in industries that are not well-suited to traditional hierarchical structures.

## How Values DAO governance is achieved?

**Values DAO** governance is achieved through the **use of sVALUES tokens** on a **Polygon blockchain network**.
**sVALUES tokens in a DAO represent a stake**, and individuals who hold these tokens have the ability to participate in the decision-making process of the organization.
The governance process works as follows:

- **Proposal:** A proposal is made by a member of the Values DAO, typically regarding changes to the organization's smart contract or other important decisions.

- **Voting:** The proposal is then put to a vote among the sVALUES token holders. Token holders can vote in favor of or against the proposal, and **the number of tokens held by an individual determines their voting power**.

- **Quorum:** To be approved, the proposal must receive a certain number of votes, known as the quorum. This threshold is specified in the DAO smart contract and can be adjusted as needed.

- **Execution:** If the proposal receives the necessary number of votes, it is executed automatically by the smart contract on the blockchain network.

The use of sVALUES tokens on a blockchain network ensures that the decision-making process is decentralized and transparent.
All transactions and decisions made by the Values DAO are recorded on a public blockchain, and can be audited by anyone.
This provides accountability and ensures that all stakeholders have access to the same information.

## Summary

In summary, Values DAO governance leverages the power of blockchain and sVALUES tokens to achieve decentralized and transparent decision-making, enabling a more democratic and efficient form of organization.
The use of sVALUES tokens ensures that all stakeholders have an equal say in the decision-making process, and the transparency provided by the blockchain network ensures that all transactions and decisions are recorded and auditable.
